# to-do-list

There are many ways and better ways to create your to-do list.  This is based on Drupal 7, a small profile for a no-frills to-do list accessible from anywhere.  You probably want to use a JS framework or a list integrated in your Alphabet, or other.  However, if you want to use this one, feel free to do so.  It is inspired on the to-do project that went unsupported in Drupal-6.  There are other light weight project management tools in D7.  Did you get yet that I am not selling you this?
